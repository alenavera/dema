kuzat aga An even better alternative is view, which starts Vim in read-only mode on Ubuntu. And since the OP asked to view and explicitly not to edit ... -1 ... of course I will take back the downvote in case this gets edited. –

@0xC0000022L :) You can keep the downvote. Feel free to add an answer on view if you want to. Vim is perfectly capable of showing files and thus this answers the question. –

I upvoted your comment first. Fine with me. But since you mentioned Vim, view would literally fit into your answer instead of a separate one. I still think that and not in some text editor is pretty clear ;) –

view is a dumb four letter alias for vim -R. If you don't use any save command like ZZ, :w or :x, there is no difference. Also you can redirect files to vim to use it as a reader: command | vim -. This is usually better than less, the only downside being that vim snarfs the entire output before displaying anything. –

@0xC0000022L: for someone fairly new to using the command line, “in the terminal and not in some text editor” could easily mean “in some utility within the terminal, not in some text editor that opens in a separate window”. When I first came to the command line, I was so used to identifying applications with their windows that I certainly thought of vim, nano, etc. as part of the terminal rather than as separate applications for quite a while. –
